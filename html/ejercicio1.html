    <h1>What is XML?</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong> (DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe <br>
            the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>The main difference between XML and HTML</h2>
    <h3>XML was designed to carry data.</h3>
    <p>

        XML is not a replacement for HTML. <br>
        XML and HTML were designed with different goals: <br>
        <br>
        XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is. <br>
        HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks. <br>
        <br>
        HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.

    <h2>XML does not DO anything</h2>
    <h3>XML was not designed to DO anything.</h3>
    <p>

        Maybe it is little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created <br>
        to structure, store and to send information. <br>
        <br>
        The following example is a note to Tove from Jani. Stored as XML: <br>
        <br>
        The note has a header and a message body, it also has senter and receiver information. <br>
        But still, this XML document does not DO anything it is just pure information wrapped <br>
        in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.
